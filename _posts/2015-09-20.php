$mypostcontent = "<p>The first week has flown by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life at <a href=\"http://www.mayden.co.uk/\">Mayden</a> looks like.</p><p>Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.</p>
<p>We have set up development environment by installing a bunch of programs like <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> - the missing package manager that allows to install, remove and update applicationa and packages;\n
<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\">phpStrom</a> - smart code editor provides excellent support for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, and many other languages;\n
<a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> - a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose;\n
<a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> - another modern text editor;\n
<a href=\"http://www.sequelpro.com/\">sequelPro</a> - a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for working with MySQL databases.</p>
<p>We have done some fun tutorials on Vim - another text editor (links available on 'Useful Links' page).</p>
<p>We have been introduced to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.</p>
<p>We were working with the Command Line and setting up our bash profile.</p>
<p>We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.</p>
<p>At last we learned how to use <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> to create a site for our blog through <a href=\"https://teamtreehouse.com/home\">Treehouse</a> tutorials and this blog is the outcome.</p>
<p>Maybe it sounds a lot and I have probably forgotten mention some of the things we have done but is was exciting and I am looking forward to next week.</p>";
