    <article class="mypostcontent">
      <p>A few years ago someone said to me: "Choose the job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life." I really liked the idea. What job would I love? At that time I had no clue and obviously my current job wasn't the dream job. So I began my search.</p>

    <p>I like photography so I signed up for university courses. Then I thought that it would nice if I could create my own website to showcase my photographs. This lead me to sign up for an <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course and finally get my degree. One of the first modules I studied was "Designing applications with Visual Basic". It made me realise that this was what I wanted to do.</p>

    <p>I always liked computing and enjoyed problem solving, but I didn't realise how much until I started discovering how a small application can be built and how its components work together. The most excitement I got was from fixing a code (which I inputted incorrectly in the first place) and getting the application working the way I wanted it to. Further I learned about creating forms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had no doubt that this was what I wanted to do, but I knew I had a long way to go before I became a software developerâ€¦</p>

    <p>I was fortunate enough to be accepted into <a href="http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/">Mayden Academy</a>. Through an intensive training programme, which is allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and work experience under the eye of professionals, I am hoping to become a software developer in just six months.</p>
